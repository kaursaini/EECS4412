'bucks for food I questioned it at first but in the end was definitely impressed Theres a section for everything from asian to indian to mexican Their smoked salmon and sushi were as good as bellagios but everything else was better I walked on for minutes just to look at what selection they had People should definitely walk to the end of the strip to try this buffet Line is super long maybe an hours wait but definitely worth it The desserts are orgasmic',?

'stars because the food once it got there was delicious Had the sliders and the beef cheek stew Sliders are served with a whipped aioli and were solid juicy slidersBeef cheek stew has a decadent jus and the meat was tender as a butcher heart HOWEVER Service was absolutely atrocious Our server was aloof and did next to nothing Obviously the busser had been trained either because as my buddy is chewing a piece of his steak the busser comes over and asks if he was all through while there is still meat on his plate too beer list and yummy pretzel bread I would return and hope for a better service and make a final judgment after that',?

'stars for actual service received for the system setup of that the Uhaul online does not give you priority service at this location It cut down on the amount of time spent at the counter but there is no line You will wait in the order of arrival whether you online or not so get there early I arrived minutes before the store opened and there were already people ahead of me By the time I pulled out in the truck I reserved reserved equipment is provided not as a guarantee just a request there were people in line I think Uhaul like airlines rental cars hotels etc should have a line if they are going to offer a Davis was very nice as was Michael who showed me to my truck It just a very busy store so get there early and give yourself extra time',?

'I give it four thumbs down This place is an enigma to me For some reason people rave about this been here twice and felt like I was being shafted when I ended up paying money for the garbage they served first glance the place looks promising sporting your basic mexican menu with all the classic combinations However upon ordering an enchilada flauta or taco this joint nose dives Bland is the best way to describe this place The salsa is laughable and the hot salsa is even one alarm They do offer a real bar or much beer so try their margarita thing for a huge disappointment I ca understand why this place has gone belly up but I guess that why I ca understand folks promoting the joint either Fili B is better than this no lies Anyone giving this place stars should be grounded from yelp for a month because there is no way that this place deserves it',?

'Based primarily on service NOT good for large groups Came here for a Wake with reservations for tables full of relatives I found that most of the servers were quite rude There were children in the group and servers acted as if they were in the way and did not treat our group with any compassion or do not expect special treatment but if a group is dining together after a funeral do you not try to tread lightly as opposed to giving rough rude unprofessional service One person at our table asked a male server to refill the tea and he snapped back After I done this I would say if you casually dining your experience may be ok but if you gon na be spending a whack loada money on hosting a group I would recommend this restaurant It somewhat embarrassing to have your guests treated in this way',?

'A Groupon is what brought my boyfriend and me to Fuego Bistro for the first time last night The cozy candlelit atmosphere was very inviting The food was phenomenal The empanadas are a must for an appetizer The crust was golden and perfectly and evenly cooked That was followed by the most flavorful short rib enchiladas I ever had The seasonal blueberry sangria was the perfect addition to a magnificent meal My boyfriend I both found ourselves taking smaller bites and eating more slowly in an attempt to savor every morsel and prolong our dining experience Will definitely be going back when the rain stops and hopefully sit in the courtyard for some live music',?

'After much deliberation we decided to head out to the buffett for a nice brunch The Wynn is always a beautiful place to walk around the air quality is even nice there versus the thick cigarette filled smoke in most other casinos there was virtually no wait in line at I got the buffett with the unlimited mary for extra and the b got the regular buffet we were seated in the garden area which is by far the best area to eat in as it has direct sunlight was our first time there and we were pleasantly surprised and liked all that they had to was truly more than any person could eat so we ate in moderation and really enjoyed not going to overboard the dessert selection especially was pretty nice I have to say it definitely a place to go try out at least once if you wan na try out a top rated buffet we thoroughly enjoyed it',?

'starsVery good taste to everything and their is comfortably the spiciest compared to any other chicken chain That just gives them enough to round up to a star review since I have to choose but the fact that their chicken is too meaty holds them back a bit which is the same qualm I had with them in BC I do love that they serve jalapeno poppers and their fries are better than they than KFC and Popeye but it ca unseat Mary Brown from the throne of chain fried chicken places',?

'Burrito Joint without UNLV LocationWhen I first heard of the concept of Japanese sushi rolls combined with Mexican food I was thrilled However upon closer inspection and digestion I found that the Mexican part of the equation was lacking severely This is a burrito joint without flour tortillas That would be like a burger place without any buns Meats like Al Pastor Adobada and Carnitas were not offered Mariscos were not included either They did even give you the option of adding Tapatio or Valentina to your burrito much less things like salsa verde and roja This is at best a Chipotle Sushi combination The food is good it made well and the service is prompt but I think the fusion especially the burrito part is a giant misnomer',?

'starsWhat bothers me most about the restaurant chain is that they have a chance to have something remotely healthy for people to eat but then they go a slather the steak in oil and butter The quality of the meat is ok but they drench it to make it really juicy A good steak DOES NOT need oil and butter to taste good A little salt and pepper is all it should take Maybe a touch of olive oil But you wo find that at Longhorn Instead the plate is covered in a layer of grease which most people slop up with their endless buckets of bread or scoop up in their mashed potatoes When i traveling i usually eat here if its a long trip but I always regret it afterward Their salad with a grilled chicken breast is bad if you need something healthy otherwise you are shit out of luck',?

'mainly because I had better gourmet pizza for very similar prices Having said that though the atmosphere was very lively in this modern restaurant Service was pretty fast but keep in mind that it takes a while for the pizza to bake so do come in starved as we did Also they DONT TAKE reservations and we had a wait time estimate of hours on arrival at on a weekday So we opted for the counter seats which have pretty fast turnover I had the prosciutto pizza which came topped in deliciousssss arugula The sauce was a little bland for me and I not a huge fan of super thin crust But if you adore thin crust pizza by all means this is the place to go The portion was a decent amount and you could probably walk away with a slices leftover for lunch the next day D which was a bonus haha Overall I did find anything special about the restaurant as a visitor to Calgary but the food was certainly decent',?
'starrrrs One of my favorite higher end restaurants in Tempe My company did a holiday dinner here and I thanked God they did We tried to book it again for the next year but they were already booked Their chicken is to die for and so are their potatoes Fresh salads that I also highly suggest Great drinks and over all good vibes The patio is super cute and great to sit outside at night Please go here You wo regret it Did I mention the service is amazing',?

'actual ratingI sometimes score at this location though not as often as I do at the Maple Leaf Gardens one I do find the medium sizes on sale items sell out in seconds which always leaves me sad On the plus side the layout is spacious and the cashiers are always fast One thing I do NOT like about this store is how they have a big nasty sign saying No Dogs Allowed Granted this is in the lobby of the building and not in Joe Fresh but still I feel the hate What the deal My dog the best shopping companion ever and until they remove that sign I can never give this place an A rating',?

'The Asian Loblaws there I said the cliche Which is true I guess if you equate Asian markets with dirty and overcrowded and Loblaws with clean and more spacious But not really much else like Loblaw despite being owned by the same company There always a great assortment of meat fish which are better than most mainline supermarkets and dry goods to write home about They even have a decent array of organics milk yogurt eggs salad and bananas I especially like the fish it fresher here than anywhere else south of Gerrard Shame about the fishmongers though they do a shoddy job scaling fish so keep an eye on them Also be prepared for a tough fight if you want your fish filleted They argue but will relent if you push',?

'years ago I got my very taste of Burakas and I have never forgotten it My absolute favorite is the Dorowot For those who are new and not knowing what to expect I find this to be a good choice for several reasons I like that is just a basic mix of chicken and carrots in a curry sauce over the rice Personally I love the spice level of it but the sour cream they serve on the side can help you make each bite less spicy with just a dip of sour cream This is one of my all time favorite meals and because I do live in the area and I craved it so muchI actually learned to make something that tastes pretty close It will never be as good as the real thing but I have gotten several people hooked on I always tell them I ca wait for them to try the real thing Buraka Dorowot over rice with lentils MMMMMMMmmmm so good',?

'Home made this is used on menus more than it should be In this case it is justified The cheese sticks and chicken fingers are home made They were great but anyplace that puts in the effort gets points in my book Now as for the pizza I break it down into parts Toppings The meat balls are delicious and may be homemade as well And I love that they use sausage crumbles not the processed chunks most other places do We got a philly steak and feta pizza as well and it was amazing The crust here is nice and thin with a crispy bottom New York style and delicious I absolutely love the sauce here it a thin sauce with strong hints of garlic and basil Prima is currently my favorite pizza in vegas',?

'STARS AUTHENTIC Taste Visiting from San Jose CA I highly disagree with the star comment about the kebab Although they were small but for platter you are purchasing a sampler platter sort of generous amount of hummus beef kebab Tzatziki and tabouleh I have also been to Dish Dash in Milpitas and i say this place is way better in taste and you are paying near for two Hummus Tzatziki and falafel are best I ever tasted The prices are really low The toubuloueh was perfection and they served unending pita bread to eat Ordered baklava made fresh from pistachio and the portions were huge Place is definitely worth going in',?
'Do believe the hype It obvious the venue paid for good press online upon their opening I say this as nicely as I can Do Not Waste Your Time First off it A LOT smaller than it looks in pictures Second the No Reservations thing creates a long and overwhelming wait And beware if it cold outside cause that where you be waiting The two managers looked like they were confused and disorganized as in they have no sort of system at all when it came to greeting and seating ppl The cocktails were decent Ca remember which one I had but it was cool I also had the Salade Blossom which was small but pretty good and the Poulet Karaage which by the way the waiter forgot to put in my order as he was lost in a kitchen of ppl all running into each other Yes I sat at the bar in front of the kitchen which was tight and uncomfortable and watched the confusion Maybe over time it get better Star',?
'for manicure They used a scrub on my arms and hands which was nice I only had that done during pedicures so it was a nice was the only one in the salon at the time but it is very big and they have a lot of pedicure stations One thing that stood out was the little kid pedicure chair It was in the shape of a buttery fly and was tiny perfect for a little girl birthday party or girls day are located right across from Bachi Burger my favorite so you can get your nails done then grab a might to eat This location never looks very busy when I over there so that a good thing No wait',?

'free I paleo and have Celiac Disease eating gluten makes me violently ill so eating out is always an adventure I was starving last night and my heart sank when I saw the line at Chipotle I checked out Taziki on Yelp and I so glad that I did With exception to the bread pita chips and one particular sauce everything on Taziki menu is gluten free Yay I went with the grilled vegetable plate and it was delicious The veggies were spiced and grilled to perfection I do know what is in their veggie marinade but I wish that I did because it was just that good I took one star off because the price is a bit high and the ordering process could be a bit clearer you grab a small paper menu just inside the door and order at the counter but I will definitely be a regular customer It hard to find a place to eat both clean and gluten free so Taziki is a gem in my book',?

'LOCATED IN WALMART SHOPPING CENTER AND NEXT TO CHIROPRACTOR I compare my favorite comic book Alternate to Battlezone Comics I think my only complaint would be that the comics were organized alphabetically rather than by style or series or its boring and time consuming especially if you into a certain type of comic And I think the new stuff should be on display not hidden in the back or behind a shelf This store has a variety of miniature collectibles sets boardgames and posters They had a very limited supply of comics and graphic novels and I not confident the owner was knowledgeable about whats But he was friendly and helpful so I will give him credit I think this place is fairly new so it bares potential I might come back if I in the neighborhood',?

'stars It a cute place located on state street and entering the store I felt like I was in Taiwan even though I never been The menu is pretty expansive and fun and included items that you be hard pressed to find anywhere else around here Tried the popcorn chicken and the sesame noodles The popcorn chicken was excellent one of the best that I had light crispy with delicious seasoning Highly recommend The braised pork bowls looked cute albeit simple but I did try it The sesame noodles were a little strange the flavor was what I was expecting exactly and it was very little food for the price Overall I noticed that the bowls are very cute and pretty but a little overpriced for how simple and how small the portions are this is truly little eats so come for a snack or a light meal not when you looking for something to fill you up I might be back for more popcorn chicken and to try out their bubble teas',?

'place is fantastic The prices are very reasonable and I have had anything from them that was less than great I hesitate to give the full five stars got ta save those for the super special places only because it a perfect place for those that live in the surrounding area It probably not worth travelling great distances unless your pastries mean that much to you they do to all being said the real hidden gem here is their pizza A slice is something like and it incredible The crust is some kind of flaky mmmmmm Seriously I know it random but check it out My friend bought a slice only because she was starving at the time and we wound up ordering more and making a meal out of it I understand you can call them up and order a whole pizza made to order for pickup if you wish Check it out',?

'stars for food taste but add a star for service Came for dim sum and the baked cha siu baos were GREAT Egg custard buns good too XLB not worth ordering and everything else was pretty standard The service was awesome though Very attentive and willing to bring you items from the kitchen They let you know if things are still cooking and they try to get it out to you as fast as they can Overall not bad for convenience but definitely not going to be your China town type of dim sum',?
'CHALLENGE decided to come here to grab a quick bite before catching a movie on one of the date nights with the hubby MEH is definitely how I would describe this place Everything we tried was mediocre at best I ordered a turkey sandwich with brie cheese It lacked the creaminess and nutty flavor the brie should provided and the French baguette it was in was hard and obviously stale The husband got the buffalo chicken sandwich which left much to be desired The dessert was another disappointment strawberry cheesecake overload which tasted very generic The prices I feel were too steep for the quality they offered The only redeeming factor I would say was the cocktail although towards the last few sips it became overwhelmingly sweet I hoping we have better luck with the brunch offerings as I still have a certificate we have yet to redeem Not in a big rush though',?
'Wong is a small Chinese Restaurant that is meant for big parties haha if it were to be described like it is in San Francisco the interior could resemble easily as a hole in the utensils provided I believe but forgot are even plastic I think haha water is also served in plastic cups What bun and I enjoy is the Thin Rib Eye with Pasta which also come with potatoes Dish is about I believe and is a hefty portion too Their Special Fried Chicken Dark Meat only is bad either Those would be my two choices I be back to try other foods This place is a great alternative for a budget meal Skip the veggies cause they could be better but if you been it do for now',?
'StarI not usually a huge fan of mexican food chains but the sweet pork here is delicious We had a chicken enchilada a sweet pork burrito and drinks which came about to roughly dollars The chicken was rather dry and nothing to write home about The pork was so tender and sweet I would definitely go back for that One big gripe I have about Cafe Rio is that the wall between CR staff and you is way too tall which makes ordering very difficult Especially for those of us who are vertically challenged',?
'CHALLENGE my way to work the mood struck me and I wanted boba stat I remember seeing a boba place right next to Wingstop on Maryland Parkway Tapioca Express that what it was The place was deserted when I got there at which worked out for me since I was pressed for time I was set in getting Oolong milk tea with boba but was quickly brought down from that fantasy to be told they were out of Oolong and Earl grey WHAT How the heck could you be out of things already when you opened barely minutes ago Nothing else appealed to me so I decided on my default flavor Matcha Snow bubble Regular size is and large is was disappointed as I had my heart set on the milk tea but the Matcha was quite tasty with prominent tea flavor so that was its saving grace The boba was too soft and mush like for my taste but I noticed it got better the longer it sat I be back and hopefully this time they wont go breaking my heart LOL',?

'Closed at PM on a Tuesday what a joke No seats except at the bar Huge table for being reserved and when the party arrived that had only ppl I saw party leave for another establishment We sat at the Bar for the first time and actually had some great cocktails This is a place for kids which detours many households from ever attending The food is something that I would take a client or guest from out of town This is a place for Victory years of age or greater The views are amazing just not a place for most of the surrounding community Verrado can enjoy',?

'The food was that good Usually Vietnamese food is pretty reliable but this just did taste right The soup was too oily and the meat was seriously lacking The menu options are very limited and a little odd I asked if the seafood noodle dish had an option to get chicken instead very normal for most Vietnamese restaurants and he said no Then he said so you do want the pork heart in it It did sound like a joke He did end up putting two slices of chicken in as a favor but that was just strange The owners were babysitting their kid or a family friend child they lifted up the child so the kid could stand on the counter and play with the stuff that was higher up This is the counter for food and she was stepping all over it with her shoes after walking all around the filthy floor Not okay',?

'The Single Best Thai Restaurant in North America not my words Jonathan Gold But as the resident LA critic extraordinaire Gold recommendation certainly warranted an investigation So on my year trip to Vegas I convinced my friends to go Lotus of Siam I ca say if Irene Virbila claim that there nothing as good or hot in LA is true since I have properly explored Thai Town in North Hollywood but I can say that Lotus of Siam can be worth the when I say that Lotus of Siam is worth a trip I did necessarily mean a drive from Los Angeles It certainly worth a dinner from anywhere on the Strip being about miles But I would leave California for this food with the diverse Thai options here in town Still I would consider a foodie visit to Vegas without a meal at the best Thai restaurant in North America',?

'review as this place just was for me I took my month old daughter hoping that it would be something we could both enjoy Being that it summer in AZ I wanted to avoid the zoo and figured this was a nice alternative I was wrong The atrium was grossly hot humid Maybe something to expect but I unfortunately did It was enjoyable no matter how beautiful the butterflies are My little girl loved it but due to being scared that she would touch one which is forbidden I carried her the entire time So if you come with kids who are be expected to carry them I would say my biggest reason for only giving stars was the admission price It way too much in comparison for the time you will spend Two adults was over while my daughter was free We spent an hour there So it was just not worth it and we wo be returning Hopefully the aquarium they are building next door wo be as big of a disappointment',?

'starsI a fan of the Big Moe franchise particularly the location by Yonge and Gerrard and was very excited to find out that there was a Markham location The halal burgers were great as expected On the the other hand the same could not be said about the service The woman working cash and the man the at the grill looked Totally understandable it not an easy job by any means and who knows how long they be clocked in However it was a VERY stark contrast to the consistent service I receive from the downtown if all you want is a burger in the Markham area you should come here',?

'Meh is so right on for describing Luma It like a diner imitating a classy restaurant Boring menu that never changes uninspired cocktail list and a deplorable beer selection I imagine they must have a lot of freezers for food storage Servers go through the motions but know better than to give much of a shit You seriously might as well just go to Eat n Park rather than paying moderately high prices for moderately bad food at Luma',?

'Food The food is delicious and looks good too It was better than some of the food I paid double for at restaurants Five thumbs Service I made a point to mention to the cashier that the food was delicious and whoever made it could cook When I dropped by all of the staff were clearly either teenagers or very early The cashier laughed and told the rest of the staff who all had a chuckle over this Overall the staff was nonchalant and indifferent Not necessarily rude but perhaps uncaring I do hope they do film each other bathing in the sinks after closing Overall I can tolerate some wiseacres to have good food at a cheap price It does happen often especially in airports',?

'stars for the location and setting food was not I had the short ribs for it took forever to come out and was not worth the price tag Kale Caesar was good crab cakes were alright The waiters are friendly and informative but not too attentive It took me forever to receive my bill and even longer to get my food wrapped to go The hosts at the front of the restaurant got my food and left it behind them to tend to customers coming in How can you run a celebrity chef celebrity owned restaurant and have clueless lazy staff running around My whole dining experience there was a waiting game and left me with absolutely no interest in coming back I will never go back there It does not live up to the hype whatsoever the drinks at the bar were good from what I saw but definitely mediocre food For ribs salad and crab cakes my bill came to all in I wish I went to the Keg instead',?

'Longer review to come Tiabi is a much welcomed oasis in the hectic rush of Las Vegas We tried the Savory Thai Basil and West Coast waffle sandwiches Both were absolutely delightful crispy on the outside and filled with fresh ingredients on the inside We definitely have to try the sweeter waffles and drinks that they known for If you a visitor to the city it worth the very quick drive to make it here Much tastier and less soggy than Bruxie on the Strip',?

'Eden no longer offers lunch which I think is for the best given the previous mediocre options though had they offered choices akin to their dinner menu I vote hellz yes to raw lunch This past week I tried the spring raw tasting menu The portions seemed smaller this time and I preferred the fall flavors in general but I am still a total fan and I think that is a fair price The raw mac and cheese was pretty impressive as was the vanilla ice cream cake We also tried a hot dish this time the tempeh mole I did not care for it because it did not have ANY vegetables just tempeh and sauce with rice But my partner really liked it I will be interested to taste how Eden treats the bounty of summer',?
'StarsHad been waiting for a good opportunity to try this truck out since I am a huge fan of New Mexican cuisine Enjoyed a sampling of pork tacos green chile chicken stew and a Sloppi Jo The pork is very similar to carne adovada tender with great flavor from the red chile sauce The stew was very good although if you have spent much time in New Mexico it will probably leave you wanting a little more spice and substance The Sloppi Jo was definitely unique incorporating the pork a up egg and pickled onions served with a tortilla and I would hesitate to order it again Although I did get the chance to try everything the sopapillas looked authentic and they were even hooking up the Frito felt that portions were a little small for the prices but I will likely be back thanks to the quality of food and perhaps a slight crush on the owner lol',?

'time visiting Gold Coast And I will admit that I was to sure about it because from looking at it from the outside it really did look like a desirable place to stay But to my surprise I really enjoyed my stay To start I will admit that I checked in before which is check in and the hostess at the registration desk was beyond nice I asked if I could check in early and I did have a special request of getting the same floor that people I was meeting were on She gladly checked and found something on the same floor and proceeded to register me early I will admit I had to walk what seemed like an never ending hall but when I got to my room I was pleasantly surprised with it The room seemed to be freshly renovated and was very clean I will say that the bed was a little harder then what I am used to but it was a very nice stay So If you are looking for a hotel that is nice inside I would recommend the Gold Coast Hotel and Casino',?

'th heaven That is how I felt after eating the Heaven at the rail From their trendy decor with meat hooks hanging from the ceiling to the truffle fries all the way to the burger was in heaven There is a lot to be said by a restaurant that puts so much time and effort into the quality and details of their food This is exactly what the rail does From the time the cook prepares the food to the moment it sitting in front of you there is only one thing to be expected the best Ohio raised beef ohio grown vegetables are only a few of the things to look forward to when visiting the rail The milkshakes are mixed style in this quaint joint and fries are cut on premise It truly a memorable experience I usually let the readers know what my favorite and what could be worked on In my opinion you can order anything on the menu with truffle fries and you be in heaven',?

'stars rounded atmosphere is dim lighting and very relaxed feeling I enjoyed that The food is tasty however they do need to learn how to serve a hamburger When I ordered my chili burger it came out well sort of served bar style The top bun was cut in half and the bottom bun was not but why would you put the burger and chili and toppings on top of BOTH buns and slop it all over the edge so I ca rearrange the sandwich I ended up having to eat it open faced with a knife and fork which is NOT why I ordered a waitress was a bit surly and unpleasant and bordering on neglectful occasionally She seemed to spend a lot more time focusing on the obnoxious table next to us who made a lot of noise I guess the squeaky wheel does get the go back It decent just not omg amazing',?

'where to begin We had the burgers Specifically the Royal burger the frontrunner on the extensive menu and presumably a dependable barbeque staple Not at Royal Meats however where the Royal is not a burger at all but an impostor a suspect grey institutional mixture of what tastes like heavily peppered pork with a healthy side of gruel Served on a quickly disintegrating interpretation of a ciabatta bun the allegedly pound patty is dwarfed by the toppings and the bun You might perhaps have ordered a side of the house salad allegedly just like a greek salad except without any dressing and with an extra portion of hard tomato cores white onion and lettuce Oh but there a sprinkling of feta as consolation for having endured the glacially slow service and surly demeanour of the staff I have had better burgers in hospital cafeterias and certainly more cheerful service Go to Apache burger or the cafeteria at Trillium',?

'We would recommend this place for a taste of something different The restaurant is popular with locals it was full at some point of the evening even on Thursday night and the food is aplenty The dishes are heavier than usual on average but make for a great dinner alternative One more option is to order some takeout to try it out prior to plunging all in The simple menus are loaded with traditional Georgian dishes as well as some more conservative options like house Greek or Caesar salads Our waitress attended to us promptly and provided some suggestions to start She assumed we can speak Russian a small community restaurant we thought We chose the appetizer platter and a large hachapuri cheese pastry This is just a bite of our full',?

'Over priced for a simple menu Not worth the Snobby staff that only take care of the older crowd that they perhaps think can afford to give a better tip that they really do not deserve The girls that work there do nothing but talk with an attitude and give dirty looks No one even offered to take our coats but every other couple there was waited on hand and there is no dress code because while we were dressed to the nines others were in track pants etc which made no difference in their service either It seemed as though we were an inconvenience and that they were just trying to get rid of us Even though we were extremely nice and gave our waiter an amazing tip which we really should have Worst never dine there again I had better service at McDonalds',?

'stars for for go here fairly often with coworkers for lunch AYCE simply because it close by and is good for a large group of people Food is average typical tempura pretty good rolls and tater tots What and sushi is okay It more of a buffet than a sushi place to me it main benefit is that there a whole variety that suits a spectrum of tastes even for those who hate sushi They also sometimes forget or delay orders and we never know whether we should order the dish again assuming that the order was left off Overall I would make an effort to go here on my own time but it a decent place for a large coworker gathering',?
'Stars if I is a must for dinner in Vegas no matter where you stay The view is incredible food is predominantly well executed and creative Corkage fee only and service and environment are truly unique and they pride themselves on the steak I thought the filet was just above average and did not come close to the requested temperature ordered medium and got rare Most of the apps were fun and creative although a bit shy of wow I will say the short ribs might be the best I have ever had and I have had a Room Jose Andres E and Olives are my favorite off the beaten path Vegas dinners',?

'StarsFinally made it over here for lunch after several recommendations from friends The place was hopping Fortunately I had read some reviews and was able to navigate the line system but I can see it being confusing for the a mix of carne adovada carne asada suadero tacos Adovada was by far the most enjoyable Suadero was tender and smoky Carne asada was passable but not my favorite in town The corn tortillas were pulled fresh off the grill and the various sauces that accompanied the tacos were flavorful Everything here was good but outside of the carne adovada I would classify anything as great Maybe my expectations were too high as the tacos had been described as a experience Who knows Service was definitely friendly and the lines move relatively quickly Bottomless horchata is a plus a pleasant experience',?

'dollar burger terrible service and the sandwich absolutely was not would say the burger was bad it was in fact relatively good Just not good especially for not coming with a side The above came from the fact that mushrooms on top were without warning from the waitress I was really looking forward to this sandwich but the overall experience led to a bust I had burgers that were more enjoyable than this at a much lower cost Having to be there for hours due to slow service was cool neither was having to split our own check while ensuring that taxes were properly calculated Having everyone drink water soda brought out with long intervals was also interesting in a bad way',?

'Nice setting smiling waitresses Original menu good presentation As expected relatively small portions and pricy but good quality ingredients Mixing ingredients tastes and textures is always risky and when the result is good it to be commended However one lacks the woaaah effect because all ingredients are mixed and merged at a same level At the end you are not sure whether you ate a toffee cake with a mango or ginger mousse and a vanilla really was it rhum raisins ice cream or a ginger or mango mousse with a small toffee cake and vanilla ice cream etc Each is good but none is really blowing your mind or exhausted by the others They indeed gently compete with each other There is no dominant flavor or ingredient Which can be good depending on your expectations and personnal preferences',?

'StarsI came here in the summer of three times and honestly I do find it that amazing The most memorable poutine was probably the one with a lot of peppers but in general I feel that it a bit The reason why I not giving them stars is because of the and waits that are really justifiable other than fact that they famous for their poutine The portions are really big and if you not here for a meal I do really consider poutine a pop a meal anywyas then you can easily split it between or people as a filling snack The location is exactly easy to get to if you do have a car we were here on vacation techncially so the walk from the center of Montreal is perhaps minutes depending on where you located Definitely give La Banquise a try if you in the neighborhood but if you not a fan of waiting in lines then you may want to consider one of the many other poutine shops in town',?

'stars rounded up Here another New Yorker perspective Came in the early afternoon which still had a steady flowing line at that time I was a bit disappointed to not see an Everything bagel available so we settled on a Cinnamon Raisin and Sesame The number of flavors are slightly lacking but they have all the basics covered Overall I say their bagels are thinner and are as thick and fluffy as I used to If you love bagels you could probably eat at least in one sitting but the ones here do quite have that addictive quality maybe its a timing thing and better off fresh in the AM Nevertheless this place still warrants a tourist visit to draw comparisons or experience a Montreal style bagel and wood fired',?

'beef extra meat please is what I always say when I come in Hidden on International Ave this place is one of the gems Calgary has to me I always ask for little sauce cause I think they generally load up on that Every time I eat here which is very late I always taste that little crisp in the beef which I like I do recall any other shawarma places in this city that have that kind of texture One of my two favorite shawarma places to go in this city My only knock on them is that I wish they would put more spice in the beef',?

'stars is more accurate Very clean and nice atmosphere with great service Unfortunately the food is extremely average little flavor in The jambalaya We ordered the Mardi Gras Pasta which the server told us was the spiciest dish on the menu and it was a huge disappointment I would maybe rate a on heat level The only positive was the size and quantity of shrimp Also order a Moscow was the equivalent of what you get at a college bar ladies night for Would not come back',?

'Rude service Waiting time was over ten minutes And the server who arranged the table was wearing a long face The pork and vegetable noodle soup was flavorless and it did not worth the price The shrimp dumplings all sticked to each other and the paper I gave some suggestions to the manager that they should use a bigger plate and separate them before steaming But she said they did have a big stove to cook them Lol are you kidding me They never want to improve the service and think about how to cook So NEVER EVER go to this place to waste your time and money',?

'Time to make the Donuts America runs on Dunkin I just love TV have been coming to this Dunkins since it first opened nearly three years ago The family who owns the franchise works very hard and is customer friendly The coffee is very good and it does have that burnt taste like SBUX On most days they give the green mermaid a real run for her money and mine On the downside the coffee sometimes can be either too strong or too weak I assuming it has to do with employees pulling the coffee from the urn too early when the backs up But otherwise it the same great Dunkin experience you would expect in the Midwest or New if you sign up for their email blasts you will receive early notices of sales and discounts Recently they had a special of two one pound bags of any of their coffees for only Nice',?

'for buffet or for buffet bottomless mimosa I thought those are reasonable prices for buffet in Vegas Great selection of food and elegant settings I felt like I was dining in a nice restaurant rather than the average Vegas buffet Not only does this place has a great selection presentation and the quality of food was definitely beyond buffet standards The only thing I thought was very good was the ham it was a bit dry But I definitely over compensated by consuming a large amount of chocolate strawberries',?

'We were tempted by their small patio with it bright flowered planters The interior was a popular choice trendy and bright but we wanted the fresh air and sunlight We were glad that our determination was not challenged and we asked for their upstairs backyard patio which was fortunately open A lot of care went into making every dish at Harvest Kitchen and we felt deeply rooted in the local Our experience came together from the small details that matter an intense chive flower an attentive waitress carefully seasoned and grilled asparagus coleslaw once put together one can feel a true touch of a great food experience Highly recommended Just a few bites from our full experience',?

'This review is from The only good thing I had there is the side cup of green chile Their red chile burritos have this taste I do like I can right now only describe as gamey or maybe it was tainted Idk Their carne asada burrito is dry and only contains meat including too much fat and lettuce Their carne asada fries are served right on the styrofoam so if you eat them you be tasting and ingesting some of that styrofoam They only come beans overly stretchy cheese and too much fat The restaurant itself has that distinctive old people smell The lady who attended to me seemed nice though',?
'time we have tried this Outback First time was a pretty frustrating experience but it was a busy Friday night so we thought we would give them a try for Sunday lunch when they were as busy After lousy experiences we wo be back Service is just very slow and at no point of the meal did we feel like the server cared Tried the steak nachos Not bad but so small they were worht the money Soup and salad all you can eat is not badly priced but the salad dressings are awful and the sald itself had nothing to remember by Potato soup not bad but not great You need to be very patient to get full at this location as they brought the salad and then it was close to minutes before they brought the first bowl of soup Maybe we will try the westside location but probably not Too many other places to eat that give much better service and value for the dollar',?
'stars for this AYCE sushi place All you can eat sushi and desserts Ca beat it It only to eat all the deep fried oysters tempura dragon rolls tiger rolls catepillar rolls sake rolls unagi rolls mochi ice cream deep fried tempura etc The only catch is that they charge you extra if you do eat the rice In addition there is a hour eating time The ambiance is all that and seems just like a regular fast food restraurant Sometimes the waiters can be very impatient and do really get your order right away since they too busy walking around I recommend ordering a ton of stuff also have lunch specials which includes miso soup and salad I usually get their two roll combo with spicy tuna roll and the salmon roll Not bad for some decent Japanese food The only thing I did like much is the new salad dressing I recommend having it on the side or just tell them to be light on the dressing',?

'wife and I stumbled upon this place during a typically hot Las Vegas afternoon and were thankful for the respite from the heat Based on its name we were expecting a shaved ice treat but it was basically a snow cone with fancier flavors There are a plethora of choices from basics like Strawberry to the more exotic such as Tiger Blood I ordered the Root Beer Float which was served with a scoop of Thrifty ice cream in the middle Not bad and it did remind me of a root beer float My wife ordered the Big Stick which was delicious It tasted exactly like the ice cream bars we enjoyed during our childhood The owners were terrific answering all our newbie questions enthusiastically and serving us quickly They even gave us a coupon for our next visit which was much appreciated Overall not a bad place for a cool snack',?

'star is being far to generous in regards to their Customer Service If the cue is so long that they disconnect you immediately when you call their service line and that is a big if You will hear such helpful hints to rectify your issues such as your modem you need a new your router you need a new your laptop you need a new your cables you need a new your jack you need a new an issue with BellAfter wasting significant time on hold troubleshooting your CSR will give you a shoulder shrug over the phone and you the customer get to repeat the whole process again the next day The support via email is much of the same You are better off getting your internet connection using a Cup String They are THE WORST',?
'Pet Friendly So great dogs up to lbs It was our party had dogs in rooms and it was great The price hike was a pain in the ass and the lack of dog park or grassy area for the dogs sucked too But free dog bowl treats and poop bags gets this place a big fat Pool Stupid that it closed at because it was degrees at when we pulled into vegas on August Really nice but no shady spots unless you have a reserved high rollers or pay money I assume The water was but it hot as heck in vegas If not for hiking the price up because of the dogs it would have been totally reasonable Location very centrally located Walked my year old sister to watch the water show at the Bellagio Walked our group of to Wynn for dinner next to Linq and High Roller ferris wheel',?
'starsI really wanted to be all over this place With a name like Thor how could you not I just always feel a bit underwhelmed whenever I leave Their menu is a bit confusing and requires explanations from the staff For example a Hit and Run is a shot of espresso while you wait and an americano to go A Mjolnir is or was it shots of espresso with condensed milk a play on a Vietnamese favourite You can only get those items if you have a few minutes to spare as those are drink in items only Would be greatly helpful if this was indicated on their menu board somewhere I also feel like pricing is a big higher than at your average independent still pop in now and then especially to FINALLY try the Mjolnir',?
'bucks for a penthouse suite stayed here for nights and it was nights that i did not regret the suite was HUGE service was quick and speedy only gripe i have against this place is because the elevators are at the back end of the entrance you have to walk pretty far just to get there through all the people smoking and gambling i wish they put the elevators closer to the front desk as it would eliminate a lot of walking',?

'update when move is off service was amazing The driver was very professional and worked with us to get our pod in the most convenient place she could in an apartment complex The only negative I have to point out at this point in the process is that the communication on how many spots are needed for a POD As far as I could see the website did not mention needing spots for the pod And when I talked on the phone with a representative nothing was ever mentioned about needing spots When the pod arrived we had not prepared spots Lucky for us our pod delivery representative worked with us and made it work We really appreciate that I feel like something on the main page of the website pointing out this would be very helpful and beneficial',?

'There is no Dana Only Zuul Ghostbusters was a great movie that showed viewers that a library can be a fun and exciting place The portal that is opened in the movie is a metaphor for the opening of the pineal gland or eye for those into Hieroglyphics I saw Rza speak last Friday at CPL He gave out copies of The Tao of Wu I had a great time and will always remember this experience At least until dementia hits It has been a few years since I have been back to the My friend commented how he remembered a field trip to CPL and he saw the world smallest book I guess they did this on all field trips There are so many great programs and I am so thankful to the CPL and Rza for bringing me back down I forgot about how great of a community resource we have in the library',?
'Degrees was delicious Very pizzas I had the Angry Bee which was soppressata garlic honey and Calabrian chiles No complaints it was sweet and spicy and amazing My only issues are that they run a little pricey though they have a special discounted pizza everyday on their IG account Also I was a little overwhelmed by the menu and options which is probably more about me and my poor decision making skills lol I go back again',?

'Just had dinner at and I agree with many other Yelpers it has a very similar vibe to El Catrin downtown The food portions are smaller and yes the drinks are higher priced but this restaurant provides a great atmosphere and it still cheaper than going downtown Their table side guacamole is delicious and the staff are warm and friendly as you get an opportunity to chat For being opened for weeks I have a feeling this joint will have a strong following The tacos tortillas are hand made and the ingredients are fresh My personal favorites were the shrimp and fish tacos They have a great deal where you can get tacos for which allows you to sample a bit of everything They also have a great mix of people and have a good selection of beverages ranging from sangrias to various tequilas This restaurant provided Port Credit with a modern fun and delicious Mexican experience',?

'brunch food in this part of Pittsburgh and even comes with a pretty huge list of spiked coffees for you to enjoy with the were celebrating a birthday here and had a reservation They were pretty accommodating for our rather large group people in their smallish space I got their grilled salmon salad sandwich while the mister got his usual eggs benedict Their sandwiches were good everyone raves about the croissant but the eggs were just definitely can be the star of a small town Coming from a bigger Metropolitan area this place is lacking a little bit perhaps in the freshness of the ingredients Where Pittsburgh is situated that could be a bit of a problem that is particularly the restaurant you in town and want to go somewhere that slightly nicer with a contemporary flair this is the place',?
'super slow No joke Even when there may seem to be little to no other customers there they are always insanely slow I would go there before work in the morning and leave myself plenty of time to get coffee and make it to work and I was still late to work a few times because I had to wait or more minutes They almost always screw up your order as have given me my stuff for free multiple times without me even asking because either the wait was so long or they screwed up my reason to come to this location is because they have a drive thru and are open',?
'have been craving greek food all week so after reading the reviews I figured I would give this place a try Ordered cheese fries and a chicken breast platter with extra rice since I already ordered fries Let me just start with the salad OMG so fresh and delicious The chicken was a little too peppery for me since I not a spicy food eater the rice was perfectly cooked and the cheese fries were good The pita was yummy as well Overall I enjoyed it and I will definitely be back for more The female who took my order was friendly and professional',?
'for bananas That what I think of when I think of No been a regular at this store for a few years They usually run out of stock on fresh produce so I stop by here almost everyday after work I also love grocery shopping store feels smaller than other No Frills the checkout lines are jammed packed during the afternoon rush I really recommend going at any other time especially if you are driving because their parking lot is tiny it fits maybe boxed salads are usually sold out They always have bread on clearance The meat can be questionable I rarely buy it here I seen yellow slimy chicken and watery ground for Customer service The grocery clerks are always restocking and always go what you need if you ask them There are a couple of really friendly cashiers as a fan of No Frills their prices are unbeatable',?
'from a FOUND ANOTHER HIDDEN GEM I mean look at that star overall rating it got ta count for came here last night to grab a mixed shawarma wrap because of sudden cravings arisen from watching the newest Avengers trailer AND LET ME TELL YOU wow value was on point purchases get off so my wrap came out to be after tax and it was HUGE So much good food for such little money what else can you ask for Oh right they also a super nice business and clean on the inside and they open late My only advice is the chicken tastes better than the beef option it more tender and I do know if it the sauce or meat itself but it was pretty salty so ask for less sauce Overall I would come back again in the future',?

'guest review now attended three different weddings at this venue All three were gorgeous and the couples very happy with their experiences The cocktail hour option on the rooftop is perfect for pictures There a living wall although the latest wedding I went to it looked kind of dead and needed some love that just screams take photos and Instagram the ish out of them pretty decent I typically forget to eat at weddings unless it a sit down meal They do a great job with setting up stations in different rooms Staff all pretty friendly I always feel bad during cocktail hour for the bartenders because they get immediately bummed rushed by the entire wedding They handled it pretty well If you looking for pre or post wedding drinks in this area North is a great option and just a couple doors down',?

'A bar is a bar right But man this place has the best burgers for a bar Seems like no matter what time I step into this place it always busy Check in on Yelp and get a free order of garlic knots The garlic knots are interesting it more like a funnel cake loaded with garlic rather than the dough ball most pizza joints give you I just remember my stomach hurting afterwards so never again But the burgers are definitely worth it I had other stuff here and it pretty decent',?
'time no complaints only accolades The menu has some of the great standbys you come here for but their farm to table approach promises new creative dishes based on seasonal options and offerings We won the lotto on servers last night Sharlie just plain rocks It one thing to be good and attentive but knowledge charm and the ability to help your guest have a memorable meal outside of the food is just natural and comes from pure care and talent Service like Sharlie delivers is greatly appreciated by someone who eats out as often as I do It easy to tire of the same hum drum you decided yet server is whose greatest concern is selling today special and increasing the average ticket cost to increase their tip Sharlie knew her stuff and was fun and engaging too I return for the food but I insist on Sharlie',?
'for a a small and medium pizza For pizza at that price level I was expecting something no less than exceptional But then again chain restaurants are usually a disappointment for my palettes Some friends that used to work at BP once told me all their ingredients are frozen out of a box I should trusted my instinct and ordered from pizza pizza for half the price plus a for coupon for the have really good deals on beer plus many large TV so you never miss a goal Great place to hang out and drink do come here if you expect good food If you drunk then dog food would taste amazing anyway So I would recommend to eat here unless you swallow a whole pitcher before',?

'starsThe buttery flaky crust and the gooey mozzarella cheese are delicious However I am a carnivore and need more to satisfy my deep dish cravings such as pepperoni and sausage And that is what I ordered along with mushrooms to top this delectable dish But I was a bit disappointed with the amount of toppings When using my fork and knife to dig in to my deep dish I like every single bite to include some meat toppings to accompany the chunky pomodora tomatoes and delicious cheese and that was not happening with this order because the pepperoni and sausage were a bit scarce to my liking I placed a carry out order so ca say much for the service but the girls at the counter were friendly and the quaint restaurant was filled with families So until I find a deep dish comparable to Chicago Uno I will be back especially for their freshly made ranch dressing which you can buy by the jar',?
'stars Came here for breakfast because we had a coupon for eggs bacon taters and toast Doesnt include drinks and that where they take the value of the coupon and shove it up your ass for the liquid tar in a cup and another for the thimble of cranberry juice The food came out quick and it was pretty good That said our meal was interrupted by the pitiful water show that went on Typical chain style and they seem to love the crazy bartenders that spin bottles in the air and then charge for shitty drink but that not my bag',?
'stars The service was good though it felt a bit understaffed the girl who served us did her best at taking care of all the tables We ordered the Tonkotsu ramen good and the Karaage bowl It does beat places like Kizuki Ramen or Ajisen Ramen maybe my standards for ramen are too high though to be honest The ramen portion is definitely smaller compared to other ramen restaurants I been to The karaage bowl was small as well but that was expected for only being I would come back for the noodles but not the rice bowl The food came out really though which was a plus Overall I just happy to have more of variety of ramen places in Phoenix',?

'Food Truck Ordered the pork chorizo and short rib tacos and then two of the fish tacos I think the three meats were a bit too oily and it distracted from the flavours The fish tacos were pretty tasty but the fish felt a bit too big for the amount of taco skin given But the taste was alright unlike the Buster Sea Cove where it just has a stinging spice in your mouth',?

'Building Though pointed out several times they couldnt care less about peanut or labelling for their container A simple label and keeping the peanut items in the bottom while not overlaying the with other items is all it would take As for coffee they made the financial really I asked decision to not have half and half available A minor thing i know but charge the extra cents a cup instead of the gas station plastic synthetic white stuff For food prep the small things matter and give customers insight into the larger stuff that we cant see Skimping on basics and ignoring customer safety us not a good business model',?

'stars overall good dining Ordered the fennel salad rigatoni ragu and the pea pesto cavatelli Both pastas were good but I was really pleasantly surprised by the pea pesto cavatelli Very interesting flavours Not much service but I did mind it as that was what I expected walking into the restaurant it is just a casual restaurant where you order your food at the counter and someone brings it to your table and at the end you walk up to the cashier and pay Will definitely go back to try their other dishes',?

'Noodle is a very small restaurant located south of Yonge and Finch that can probably sit around people It is usually packed so try to come on the off hours if you want to avoid the wait The Bang Bang Mian was very good It had a great range of flavours and the texture of the noodles was great Definitely reminded me of some of the dishes I had when I was in a few years ago I found the Pork was far too oily the bun was soggy on the bottom because it was swimming in its own oil Though it a relatively cheap dish so I suppose I ca complain too much about it The Zha Jiang Mian was as good as the Bang Bang Mian I found it could have been a bit punchier with flavour I would come back to Artisan Noodle but definitely on off hours Not sure if it worth lining up for if the wait is going to be more than especially in the winter Still a decent place nonetheless',?

'there with fairly high expectations after reading other reviews and I must say I was a little disappointed Walked in to order takeout and the smell of food wafting from an open kitchen and the actual Thai staff definitely seemed promising I ordered Pad Woon Sen shrimp and Massaman Curry chicken Granted that both dishes were consumed after a few hours they help up pretty well My disappointment was from the flavours themselves Both dishes were fairly well executed with complex enough flavours but just too sweet for my liking They were both much better after adding a heaping spoonfuls of Nguoc Nam and another sauce they provide The hot pepper sauce was right up my alley and not vinegary at all I would probably go back to try different dishes but my vote for best Thai still stands with Siamese Gecko in Collingwood Alas I ca possibly drive hrs every time I get a Thai craving',?

'stars because it a motel and the expected quality should be that high to begin withPros to have been recently good wifi includedCons people hanging around all night in front and air conditioning few towels and wash dirty cheap beds even for a motel understand that this is a dollar a night place and that it a motel However I still expect more quality out a hotel I should have to take my zune and stereo out of my car so that I feel safe being parked for the night',?
'A Filipino restaurant tucked into the Baldwin street of Toronto It has small floors of dining space We were seated upstairs facing a mural wall of a large rooster and school bus The chairs are small and not that comfy for a petite girl like me I ordered the waffle and fried chicken dish and it was a disappointment for The yam waffle was cold and not crispy at all At least the chicken was hot The pieces of chicken had bones and the same size as a chicken wing place Nothing special about it The coleslaw was tiny My partner dish had a small portion to it for lunch so he was definitely still hungry The service was mediocre The waitress asked as a couple of time if we wanted their sweet buns and we rejected the offer but she still kept on asking Its not free Verdict we obviously wo be going back It was a pricey lunch and the tummy was not satisfied',?

'stars rounded up My party of three ended up here after learning the wait for Bacchanal was a three hours long forcing us to breakaway from our usual try someplace new Buffalo wings were some of the best I had meaty not overly acidic HH pricing was a plus Two out of three cheeses on charcuterie platter were of the blue variety which two out of the three of us did appreciate Steak Ale Pie was blanketed in a buttery golden crust had a generous amount of beef mushrooms root veggies in a salty gravy His ribeye looked slightly overcooked he called it buffet quality I get it we at a pub not a steakhouse but a steak should disappoint She had bangers mash liked the variety of sausages except for the chicken which had little flavor Dessert was a heavenly decadent Sticky Toffee Pudding and a lighter Eaton Mess with berries Delicious',?
'daily resort fee covers two devices for internet then an additional or charge for a third device is absurd The person I was staying with and I did not have network access on our phones in our hotel room so we connected our phones to the wifi Connecting one of our laptops to stream music while we ready for maybe an hour each day was a day Our side of the hotel did not have mobile network access if we walked down the hall we could get service It frankly unacceptable that there is a device limit of two per room when network access is limited in a part of the hotel Combined we most likely spent less than hours streaming or using the internet and paid upon receiving our receipt We stayed for one week and the resort fees plus internet fees totaled',?
'CHECK IN FOR A FREE SODA I got a hot tea instead Excellent dinner Secret is come at because at okay after it starts to get crowded pretty quickly And when that happens you do get your food as fast since they have to serve everyone else of the menu is good Did not like the ribeye one per person since it was overcooked and tough My girl loved the pork belly sizzling oh yeahh and thankfully it was nicely thin The ceviche was refreshing the uni NOT good not all the rolls great but beware they are filling and you will have leftovers that you must force down The oysters were also a bit meh A must get also is the soft shell crab we got more than we should have Great place to dine with a large party just make a reservation early which they will call to confirm again',?

'A GPS will be your best friend in this place Leave early and have transportation arranged The convention center is huge to say the least and the shows are awesome I usually got to the CES to check out the new gadgets and electronics Food here is OK for a convention center and you usually do have to walk a mile for a bathroom only a half mile As an exhibitor this place is frustrating If you have a small booth you will often find tons of other peoples crap in it if you are there like days early And it is a freaking ZOO trying to get out of these when it closes either by bus or taxi the traffic is incredible',?
'I am a locale and went with a friend from Jersey My friend was intrigued as they advertised homemade corned beef hash She said it was excellent I had th Omelet with Avocado and Shrimp topped with a Chipolte sauce that was amazing They also feature Coffee Cartel drip coffee which is a nice added touch to this little hidden away gem in Old Scottsdale If you want to have the homemade touch this is the place to go It is small so it can see where the wait may be long if there are many people like on a Saturday or Sunday morning I had no wait issues but I did go on a Monday morning after There is nothing fancy about this place but it is quaint and laid back with great food I highly recommend you give this place a try You will not be disappointed with the food',?

'buffet Better than most in quality although not as complete as the rest of the high end buffets Prime rib was tender and served blood red as requested The horseradish sauces creamy and pure horseradish were pleasingly spicy The sushi was the low point and was poor even by buffet standards It fell apart on the plate and the rice did not have a sticky low review is a result of the lack of customer care We were a party of seven and paid separately due to expense account issues Asking pleading cajoling and finally bitching could not convince the staff to seat us at a single table We were treated indifferently and we seated at two separate tables Fortunately the wait staff did not act as the reception staff and treated us wonderfully The positives could not possibly outweigh the lack of management response',?

'years in at San Marbeya and it gets worse every day The people upstairs must have though this was a frat house After calling many times supposedly they are moving out a new apt on the same property Makes a lot of sense to have them bother another tenant All about the Almighty dollar Called Mark Taylor about another issue left a message and NEVER received a call back The new manger Jackie is also another one that does return phone calls The security on the property is a joke as well They are either no where around on the property or apparently from another reviewer they are harassing tenants Too many other living options around to deal with the unprofessional attitude at San Marbeya',?

'Visit I would probably give the food more stars but ummm they did even give me all of the food that I ordered It was my first time at this place and again although the food was pretty good I never go to this specific location because of my experience with the cashier that I had to deal with It must have been this clown worst day Either way I will never go to this location again Damn I should have took his name down',?

'A British Pub in an old house smack dab in the middle of PHX Of course I going to love beers on tap gouging prices Should be a five I hold back because the food menu was sparse at best We did even bother given the lack of choices Also since there was nobody there on the early Saturday afternoon it was an issue but the bathrooms location and lack thereof could be a problem on a busy Friday think my favorite part may have been the giant paintings of British icons scattered throughout the bar It set a nice tone and provided an atmosphere in the place that made me immediately think I can see myself getting hammered here',?

'Walk Through Review Excalibur is a cool site to see driving down the Vegas Strip It looks like a giant King Arthur inspired castle Walking through Excalibur was interesting but there was anything that felt compelling enough to check out a second time The entryway and lobby are cool because they are decorated in the same fantasy theme but it ends pretty quickly after that The casino area seemed fairly outdated and in need of renovation The theme is really cool and could be amazing if properly executed but Excalibur just seems a little rusty',?

'for one beer one spicy tuna roll and one bowl of pork noodles i was expecting a gourmet feast at least the beer was consistently good prices must be driven by real estate inside of the luxor because it had nothing to do with the two stars it received is for the decor which can only be described as modern cheap and the excellent service my waitress was great the other stars it did NOT receive is because the spicy tuna roll was old as in stale rice not to mention the pork in the noodles was much like those cartoon characters you see eating an old shoe out of not have great vibes about this place but whatever i had to spend that voucher somewhere',?

'our waiter was really spectacular We sat in the bar area in a booth and the young man was prompt and clear with cook times I must say the hostess and what looked like her boyfriend could be more welcoming They were to busy gazing into each other eyes to be courteous The busser was quick to remove dishes and even filled our water at times Pizza stars due to lack of toppings in our mighty meat stuffed pizza including cheese The stuffed pizza at Sbarros was better than this and Oreganos blew it out of the water I will be returning Not anytime soon because I had Gioradanos in Chicago and it was delicious Dessert DO NOT GET THE SALTED CARAMEL COOKIE Please do let this location ruin a great legacy I think Giordanos has It expensive do rip us off on toppings and flat soda',?
'starsWe hired Arizona Foundations Solutions to evaluate a crack in our Saltillo tile Our consultant Ryan Tracey was extremely helpful and informative throughout this process An engineered analysis was completed to ensure that we did not have any underlying foundation issues in our recently bought home We did have to wait for an initial evaluation compared to other companies and we also had to wait a few weeks for the results of our engineered analysis We attributed this wait to the busy holiday season Ultimately we are very happy we chose to complete our repair with Arizona Foundation Solutions We are highly satisfied with the quality of their work The quote for the repair was less than other companies and they deducted the price of the engineered analysis from the repair We also felt we were dealing with an honest company as they did not suggest or pressure us to make any unneeded repairs',?
