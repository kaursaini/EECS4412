Data Mining Project - Text Classification

Goal - The goal of our project is to classify Yelp reviews about different businesses and services as
positive, negative or neutral review. This classification helps customers to decide which
business or service to choose (they will go for one with positive reviews). The reviews and the
classification also helps businesses to realize their flaws and fix them as per customerâ€™s
opinions.

Text Classification
Text mining is the process of extracting relevant information from natural language text and
finding interesting relationships in between the entities extracted. This process gets a bit
challenging when we work with high-dimensional data sets with arbitrary patterns of missing
data.
